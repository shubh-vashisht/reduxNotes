Module bundlers: 
    Basically they take all the javascript and combine them to form a single
    javascript file that can be used to deploy the webapp.
    Without using a module bundler, you wont be able to use npm modules for your webapp because
    the app does not know how to combine npm module files in node_modules folder.
